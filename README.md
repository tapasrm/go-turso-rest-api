# Turso Connection with Go App.

A Simple REST API to perform CRUD Operations on a collection of albums.

Can use Turso DB or local sqlite files for the database. Great for applications which have a low data footprint.

API is Blazingly Fast ðŸš€ when used with local sqlite3 file.
Below is a result of a stress test with 1000000 requests from 125 concurrent connections.
